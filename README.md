# SI564 SQL and Databases Final Project

# Objective
* Find some data online.  
* Normalize the data (at least 4 tables)
* Entire data set should contain at least 100 rows total
* Your data should have properly defined keys
* Create your tables, insert your data, and then write and answer a homework-style assignment for the dataset

# Deliverables

1) Your database documentation, including ERD diagrams.

2) Homework-style assignment: A letter from someone at your fictional company outlining important questions they need answered from the dataset. This should have at 7-10 questions in it. 

3) The answers to the questions posed in the letter (including your queries to get the result).

4) An outline of why you made the database design choices you made. 

5)  A .sql file containing your exported database.
